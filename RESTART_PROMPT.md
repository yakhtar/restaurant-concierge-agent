## **CONTEXT SUMMARY**

I'm working on an **Enhanced Restaurant Concierge Agent** with advanced AI search capabilities. Here's the current state:

### **✅ COMPLETED**
- **Enhanced Search & Discovery System**: Smart intent detection, entity extraction, multi-filter search

- **Deployed API**: https://restaurant-concierge-agent.onrender.com (auto-deploys from GitHub)
- **4 Sample Restaurants Generated**: Mario's Italian Bistro, Dragon Palace Chinese, Bella Vista Italian, Sakura Sushi Bar

### **🧠 KEY INTELLIGENCE FEATURES**
- **Smart Query Processing**: "Find cheap vegetarian Italian restaurants" → extracts cuisine, dietary, price filters
- **Search Scoring**: Results ranked by relevance, rating, and matching criteria
- **Confidence Routing**: High-confidence queries get direct results, unclear ones get clarification
- **Rich Responses**: Includes wait times, dietary info, special features, quick actions

## **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED**

Please help me:
1. **Get back up to speed** with the current enhanced system
